# Task List Project  

This is a simple task management app built with Laravel. The goal of this project is to help me get more familiar with the Laravel framework by building a CRUD-style application where users can create, update, and delete tasks.  

## Getting Started  

To run the project locally, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone
cd task-list  

2. Install PHP dependencies:  
composer install  

3. Copy the .env file and generate the application key:  
cp .env.example .env  
php artisan key:generate  

4. Update your .env file with the correct database credentials:  
DB_CONNECTION=mysql  
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1  
DB_PORT=3306  
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name  
DB_USERNAME=your_username  
DB_PASSWORD=your_password  

5. Run the database migrations:  
php artisan migrate  

6. Start the development server:  
php artisan serve  

Once the server is running, go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the application.
